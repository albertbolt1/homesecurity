    <h3>FEATURES</h3>
    <h3> 1.Face Detection in critical region </h3>
        <p>
            It analyses the critical regions to get the faces of the people(intruders) who roam around in the 
            critical regions because people who rob the items must be present in the critical region.
        </p>
   
    <h3>
        2.Image subtraction to detect missing objects</h3>
        <p>
            Image subtraction is used to know about the missing objects and it will have a folder for missing
            objects to identify which objects were robbed by the robber. The sensor data will be a json file
            which is deciphered using pandas, which reads json and get the data. 
        </p>
    
    <h3>
            3.Light Sensors </h3>
            <h4>Misemploy of light</h4>
            <p>
                In the night time due to darkness robbers use torches and these changes in light is captured 
                by light sensors from the mobile and these can be used to warn or sound the alarm.
            </p>

                4.Warning system </h3>
                <p>
                    The user gets alert when,<br>
                    1.Light is used in unusual time.<br>
                    2.When the device battery is low.<br>
                    3.When the device is being messed with<br>
                    And gives the mail alerts when robbery situaton is detected through sensors to the police
                    by sending location of home when user is out of station.
